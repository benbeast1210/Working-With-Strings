# Working-With-Strings

> This Python project contains two functions:
>
> *letter_frequency* will take in a word to check, and a letter to check for. It will return an integer denoting the number of times the *'letter'* appears in the *'word'*.
>
> *word_length* will take in text as input, and output an integer denoting the average length of eath word in the *'text'*.
>
> *longest_word* will take in a string as input and perform a .split method on it to prepare for recursion. Then, I check for the longest word by defining two new variables. I then use the index of the  longest word to locate it for the print statement.
